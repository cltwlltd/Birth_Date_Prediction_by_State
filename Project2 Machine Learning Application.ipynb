    "Birth rate has a massive impact on the economy. As the birth rate drops, the proportion of elderly people increase, which follows serious economic consequences. Health care costs for the elderly will strain resources, while the smaller working population will struggle to produce enough income tax revenue to support these rising costs. It’s likely this will cause spending power to decrease, consumerism to decline, job production to slow – and the economy to stagnate. For more information, refer to the link below:\n",
